1. Description of the Object:
	
	--A revolver is a repeating firearm that has a revolving cylinder 
	  containing multiple chambers and at least one barrel for firing.
	  The term "revolver" refers to a handgun, but other weaponsmay also
	  have a revolving chamber. These include some models of grenade
	  launchers, shotguns,and rifles.

	--Though the original name was "revolving gun", the short-hand 
	  "revolver" is universally used.(Cannons using this mechanism are
	  known as revolver cannons.) Nearly all early revolvers and many 
	  modern ones have six chambers in the cylinder, giving rise to the
	  slang term "six-shooter”,however, revolvers with 3 to 24 chambers 
	  have been made,with most modern revolvers havin 5 or 6 chambers.

	--The revolver allows the user to fire multiple rounds without 
	  reloading.Each time the user cocks the hammer, the cylinder revolves
	  to align the next chamber and round with the hammer and barrel,which
	  gives this type offirearm its name.

	--A revolver works by having several firing chambers arranged in a
	  circle in a cylindrical block that are brought into alignment with
	  the firing mechanism and barrel one at a time. In contrast, other
	  repeating firearms,such as lever-action, pump-action, and 
	  semi-automatic,have a single chamber and a mechanism to load and 
	  extract cartridges into it.
